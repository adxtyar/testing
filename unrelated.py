I want an automation that runs on my local machine. It should:

1. Use Python to collect current system performance data like CPU usage, memory usage, disk usage, and the top 5 running processes.
2. Save this data into a `.log` file inside a folder named `logs/`. The log file should be named using the current timestamp.
3. Then, the system should read all existing `.log` files in the `logs/` folder.
4. It should analyze the logs and summarize trends such as average CPU usage, peak memory usage, most frequent high-CPU process, etc.
5. Finally, it should save this summary into a file called `summary_report.txt` in the root project folder.

The entire workflow should be implemented using CrewAI with separate agents handling system monitoring, logging, parsing logs, summarizing data, and generating the final report.
